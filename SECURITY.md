# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities privately to: `security-contact@example.com`.

Do not open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

## Security Guidance

- Do not include secrets or tokens in issues, pull requests, or logs.
- Review the code before using it in production.
- Use OpenProject API tokens with the principle of least privilege.
- Rotate tokens if exposure is suspected.
